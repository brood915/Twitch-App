# Twitch App

Demo: https://brood915.github.io/Twitch-App/

```
A twitch application that allows users to search for 
& save their favorite streamers to the local storage. 
This consumes Twitch REST APIs to show the streamers' info, including their live status. 

Very handy to check your favorite streamers' status all at once!

Some active twitch streamers: 

esl_sc2, esl, storbeck, starladder1, hanryang1125

Used HTML, CSS/SASS, ReactJS, and Twitch REST APIs.

```


### To run this application

```
npm install
npm run start
server running at localhost:1337
